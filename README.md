**Minimum Supported Rust Version:** 1.41.1

# Miniscript

Library for handling [Miniscript](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/miniscript/),
which is a subset of Bitcoin Script designed to support simple and general
tooling. Miniscripts represent threshold circuits of spending conditions,
and can therefore be easily visualized or serialized as human-readable
strings.

## High-Level Features

This library supports

* [Output descriptors](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md)
including embedded Miniscripts
* Parsing and serializing descriptors to a human-readable string format
* Compilation of abstract spending policies to Miniscript (enabled by the
`compiler` flag)
* Semantic analysis of Miniscripts and spending policies, with user-defined
public key types
* Encoding and decoding Miniscript as Bitcoin Script, given key types that
are convertible to `bitcoin::PublicKey`
* Determining satisfiability, and optimal witnesses, for a given descriptor;
completing an unsigned `bitcoin::TxIn` with appropriate data
* Determining the specific keys, hash preimages and timelocks used to spend
coins in a given Bitcoin transaction
* `no_std` support enabled by disabling the `default-features` and enabling
`"no-std"`. See `embedded/` for an example.

More information can be found in [the documentation](https://docs.rs/miniscript)
or in [the `examples/` directory](https://github.com/apoelstra/rust-miniscript/tree/master/examples)


## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)
This library should always compile with any combination of features (minus
`no-std`) on **Rust 1.41.1** or **Rust 1.47** with `no-std`.

Some dependencies do not play nicely with our MSRV, if you are running the tests
you may need to pin as follows:

```
cargo update --package url --precise 2.2.2
cargo update --package form_urlencoded --precise 1.0.1
```

## Contributing
